So when you use a server component inside the ContextProvider [ActiveSectionContextProvider], 
it doesn't mean the children and everything within that component is now a client component.
As long as it is been passed as children, they can still be server component and this is because 
of how high up the ContextProvider is in the Tree.
The only it might become a client component and defeat the whole purpose of nextjs since it going to be in the layout file and 
possibly wrap the whole page is if 
1. I imported the actual component say for example I imported the proojects.tsx in the ContextProvider file, then it's no longer
a server component but a client component.

2. If I directly passed a supposed server component to the ContextProvider[ActiveSectionContextProvider] as a prop instead of children
so if I did <ActiveSectionContextProvider content={<Projects />} />
